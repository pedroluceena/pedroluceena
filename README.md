## About me

I work at a Nuclear Energy company, Eletronuclear, as a Software Development intern.

I'm in college, and I should finish soon. Currently, I want to pursue a career as a software engineer using [.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/dotnet/what-is-dotnet) I also program in [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/pt-BR/docs/Web/JavaScript) On the database side, I use [SQL Server](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads).
I believe that the technologies I am learning are essential for a software engineer's career. I look forward to continuing to learn and develop in this area.
Next steps are to learn [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/) or [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/pt/).

### Interests
I am passionate about writing and analyzing films, series and games. I'm also a big fan of open-source projects and want to contribute to the technology community one day. I currently write short articles on Dev.to. These are basic articles, but I believe they are a good start for content production. Thank you for reading!
